# Master’s thesis

This is where the text of my master’s thesis lives.
It’s extremely work-in-progress, and you probably shouldn’t be looking at it yet.

This will probably be published under some open license,
but I haven’t cleared that up yet.
For now, you can take a look, but please don’t do anything else with it (including redistribution).

Obviously, I cannot accept contributions to this repository.
