# Master’s thesis

This is where the text of my master’s thesis lives.
It’s still being written, and nowhere near finished yet.
If you want to give me feedback already,
[a recent-ish PDF version][pdf] is available,
though it may not always be completely up-to-date with the latest changes to the TeX source.

## License

This will probably be published under some open license,
but I haven’t cleared that up yet.
For now, you can take a look, but please don’t do anything else with it (including redistribution).

Obviously, I cannot accept contributions to this repository.
If you notice a typo or something, please let me know without sending a patch.
