# Master’s thesis

This is where the text of my master’s thesis lives.
It’s not done yet, but I’m getting there (the deadline is October 15th).
If you want to give me feedback,
[a recent-ish PDF version][pdf] is available,
though it may not always be completely up-to-date with the latest changes to the TeX source.
