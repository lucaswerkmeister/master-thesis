\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:Background}


\section{Wikidata}
\label{ch:Background:Wikidata}

Explain the Wikidata data model,
the central role of the community,
and perhaps some fundamental properties.

Also explain the RDF export
and the query service,
and how theyâ€™re derived from Wikidata,
not the canonical source of truth.


\section{Shape Expressions}
\label{ch:Background:ShEx}

How they work.

Difference between v1 and v2?


\section{RDF2Graph}
\label{ch:Background:RDF2Graph}

Summarize how RDF2Graph works?
The distinction between the steps
(main, simplify, ShEx export)
is likely to be significant for the rest of the thesis.
