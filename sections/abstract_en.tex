\Abstract
% TODO this is a very terse version. I’m not sure if it needs to be longer? incorporate bits of the introduction as motivation? perhaps even more than one paragraph?
To provide an additional quality control mechanism for Wikidata,
a tool to automatically infer data schemas from a set of exemplary Wikidata items
was developed and evaluated.
Though the resulting schemas are usually not fit for direct validation,
they can still be useful as a form of describing the layout of an area of Wikidata’s data model,
a way to see potential issues in the source data, % TODO “see” sounds weak, but “highlight” is too strong a word IMHO given that you have to comb through the schema to find issues
or a basis for a manually curated schema.
