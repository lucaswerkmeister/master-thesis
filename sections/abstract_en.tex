\Abstract
% TODO should be longer (1-2 paragraphs, not more than half a page), including a few sentences about Wikidata and its importance, the problem, and my contribution
\acrlong{shex} are a promising additional quality control mechanism for Wikidata,
the free knowledge base in the Wikimedia movement,
but larger schemas can be tedious to write,
making automatic inference of schemas from a set of exemplary items an attractive prospect. % TODO is “prospect” a good word here?
This thesis investigates % TODO investigated? which tense?
this option by updating and adapting the RDF2Graph program to infer schemas from a set of Wikidata items,
and provides a web-based tool which makes this process available to the Wikidata community.
Though the resulting schemas are usually not fit for direct validation,
they can still be useful as a form of describing the layout of an area of Wikidata’s data model,
a way to see potential issues in the source data, % TODO “see” sounds weak, but “highlight” is too strong a word IMHO given that you have to comb through the schema to find issues
or a basis for a manually curated schema.
