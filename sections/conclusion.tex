\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}

The goal of this thesis was to investigate how \gls{shex} schemas can be automatically inferred for Wikidata,
and how useful the resulting schemas are.
This was done using an updated and adapted version of the RDF2Graph software,
which was made available to the Wikidata community
through a new web-based tool.

In addition to the changes specific to Wikidata,
many general improvements to RDF2Graph were made over the course of this thesis,
making it easier to use and more robust on any graph.
All these changes are available under the same free software license as the original RDF2Graph,
and I hope that some of them will be included in the original source code repository in the future.
